These are some of mmy favorite projects that I have completed throughout grad school:

[Sentence Autocompletion with an RNN](#proj1) <br>
[Generating Jazz Solos with an RNN](#proj2) <br>
[Building a Mobile System for a Robotic Arm](#proj3) <br>
[Recoloring Black and White Images using a CNN](#proj4) <br>

All of these papers can be found on my GitHub with their code. Project #3 was a part of the "Special Problems in AI" course which was mandatory for my degree. The others are final projects from my classes in: Pattern Recognition and Classification, Deep Learning, and Applied Machine Learning.
