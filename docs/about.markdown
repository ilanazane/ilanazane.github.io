## Eduation 

Ilana Zane has her B.S. in computer science with a minor in french literature from Rutgers, New Brunswick. She is currently at Stevens Institute of Technology pursuing her M.S. in Applied AI and Mechanical Engineering-- which means I take a lot of machine learning classes, some robotics classes and when the two overlap I am super happy :) 

## Personal Intersts 

My hobbies include 3D Printing ( I have an Ender 3V2 which has been amazing), bullet journaling, gardening, and playing tennis.
