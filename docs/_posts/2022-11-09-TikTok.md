Made an articulated octupus today! I'm still learning how to create videos on TikTok (the text was messed up), but I was able to successfully print this articulated octopus and film a tutorial for someone who had asked how to do it on a previous video. 

This is a pretty popular model on thingiverse and I tried to print it a few months ago, but wasn't able to get past the first few layers before the whole thing fell off the bed. Yesterday I tried again, but what met with the same issue. The bed wasa leveled several times and I messed around with different bed plate temperatures and fan speeds, without success. An hour and five failed prints later I decided to print with a brim. I usually avoid brims as they take a while to print and use a lot of filiment, but it was necessary. Each articulated piece that makes up the leg is so small it needed the extra surface area to stay in place. The print took about four hours at 60 mm/s and 30% infill and the brim/ additional supports came off easily which was a relief. 

Now that I know how to print this, I think I'll make a few more in fun colors for my younger cousins.
