# Recoloration

Image recoloration and restoration from black and white photos is an arduous process requiring artistic skill, understanding of color composition, 
and Photoshop experience. How- ever, there are now several ways to utilize the power of machine learning to recolor images in a fraction of the time. 
Popular methods of recoloring involve using generative adversarial networks (GAN) or convolutional neural net- works (CNN). 
In this paper, I attempt to create my own version of a CNN to recolor black and white images, and explore how well the network performs when it is 
provided with images that are missing information. In the following sec- tions I explain my approach and results from the project.woo
