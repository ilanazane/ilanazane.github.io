<h1>Introduction</h1>
Inventory optimization is an important topic to focus on in the context of inventory/ supply chain managementâ€“ optimizing inventory at the first level of the supply chain has the ability to affect the rest of the supply chain. An effective way to optimize the inventory is through artificial intelligence. This paper reviews AI methods that optimize inventory such as Some methods that are reviewed include variations of neural networks, genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning.

ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS
Sustrova [1] discusses the construction and results of an artificial neural network (ANN) model that can be used to optimize inventory level and therefore improve the ordering system and inventory management. The work presented in that paper suggests that by using an ANN, the future order amount can be planned based on predicted demand and thus, inventory management can be improved as a part of supply chain management.

PREVIOUS WORK
Previous methods to optimize inventory management have included the EOQ model, ELSP model, Wagner-Whitin model. These methods are based on assumptions that can be restrictive and do not correspond to realistic manufacturing practices. Some of these methods like the ELSP model are computationally NP-hard problems. Thus, using soft-computing methods such as an ANN can solve the lot-sizing problem for production planning systems in an effective and robust manner.

METHODOLOGY
The ANN that was used in this paper [1] was created using a basic, three layer network that consisted of six input parameters connected to eight hidden neurons that then fed into one output value (6-8-1 architecture). The six input variables consisted of the current demand (IDact), demand in the next three months (ID3), demand in three months following the 3-months order cycle (ID33), current inventory level (II), purchase price (IP), and transport costs (IT).
