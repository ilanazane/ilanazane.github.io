title: "The Dynamic Window Approach to Collision Avoidance"

I have spent a good portion of my summer research internship reading papers about path and trajectory planning for robots as a 
way to familiarize myself with the concepts that I am employing while coding or learning new software. 
My advisor recommended that I read *The Dynamic Window Approach to Collision Avoidance* written by Fox, Burgard and Thrun. 
Below is a summary of what I understood from the paper.

# The Issue  
The authors of this paper propose a novel approach to reactive collision avoidancve for synchro-drive mobile robots called dyanmic windows. In short, the dynamic window approach is employed to 
reduce the search space that the robot needs to evaluate when navigating through an environment with obstacles. The dynamic window is a set of velocities that get the robot to its goal while also avoiding obstacles along the way. 

# Related Work 
Besides dynamic based trajecotry planning, there are two other common approaches: potential-field based and sampling based.
