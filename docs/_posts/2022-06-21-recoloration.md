# Recoloration

Image recoloration and restoration from black and white photos is an arduous process requiring artistic skill, understanding of color composition, 
and Photoshop experience. However, there are now several ways to utilize the power of machine learning to recolor images in a fraction of the time. 
Popular methods of recoloring involve using generative adversarial networks (GAN) or convolutional neural networks (CNN). 
In this paper, I attempt to create my own version of a CNN to recolor black and white images, and explore how well the network performs when it is 
provided with images that are missing information. In the following sections I explain my approach and results from the project. woo
