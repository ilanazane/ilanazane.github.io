This past week has definitely been the highlight of my fall. On Sunday, I joined my cousin on her first Girls on the Run 5k. Girls on the Run is a club that she is a part of through school and she needed a buddy to join her-- I was more than happy to as I have never run a 5k before. Luckily I've already been preparing for the 5k that I signed up for this coming December. We were out of the house at 7:30 in the morning and an hour later running in 20 degree weather. Spirits were high throughout the run and we didn't stop once! Super proud of ourselves-- it's not easy running in that weather. 

The rest of the family was standing at the end of the finish line, waiting for us with signs. It was a great experience and I hope I can do it again in the spring.

Will was with me in the days leading up to Thanksgiving. We walked around The Wharf DC on Monday and ate a ton of seafood at The Grill.

The following day we did homework at Philz Coffee in Ballston because we are obsessed with Philz. Guus stepped out from work to say hi to us. It was nice revisiting the area; I haven't been there since the summmer of 2019 when I worked at E*Trade. We had lunch in the Ballston Quarter Market at my favorite Rice Crook and then got a smoothie from South Block-- I missed my blue mermaid smoothie so much.

On Wednesday, the cousins had school off for the upcoming holiday. One of the twins was under the weather, so Will and I took the other two to the Museum of Natural History to get out of the house. It was chaos-- as is expected when you visit a museum when every child in the DC area has off. We divided our time between the Human Origins exhibit and the Gems & Minerals exhibit. Snack time consisted of raisins and icecream.

One morning one of the twins left me a little envelope on the table before he left for school. There was a small diamond inside. Oh and here is my classic apple pie-- turned out great this year.
