This week in the lab we have been fiddling around with more ROS packages and still learning our way around using RViz and Gazebo. I was able familiarize myself with the ROS navigation package, specificaly with a simulated husky robot. I used the *move_base* node with the husky robot to perform basic autonomous planning and movement.

From what I understand, given a goal in a simulated world *move_base* will attempt to move the mobile base to a goal i.e. it links together a gloabl and local planner to accomplish a global navigation task. 

I was able to run the simulations, but I would like to learn more about the theory behind the navigation package and how all of the nodes are linked together and understand the amcl algorithm a bit better.
